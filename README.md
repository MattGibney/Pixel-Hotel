# Pixel Hotel

Welcome to Pixel Hotel, a project dedicated to reviving the classic experience
of the original Habbo Hotel. Our aim is to reverse-engineer and recreate the
backend services that powered the iconic multiplayer game, allowing you to
relive the nostalgia of the early 2000s in a fully functional environment.

## Project Overview

Pixel Hotel is not just about the end product but also about the journey. We are
committed to documenting the entire process in detail, from understanding the
underlying protocols to implementing the various features that made the original
game so beloved. This repository will serve as both a development project and an
educational resource for those interested in game development, reverse
engineering, and online multiplayer systems.

## Goals

* Recreate the original Habbo Hotel experience: Develop a fully functional
server capable of running the original version 1 of Habbo Hotel.

* Document the process: Provide detailed documentation on the protocols,
architecture, and challenges encountered during the development.

* Foster community involvement: Encourage contributions and feedback from the
community to enhance and refine the project.

* Simulate original gameplay: Populate the server with bots to replicate the
lively and interactive environment of the original game.

## Progress

We are currently in the early stages of development and are focusing on the core
features of the server, such as authentication, room management, and chat
functionality. We will be updating this repository regularly with our progress
and insights gained from the development process.

## Additional Functionality

In addition to the core features of the server, we plan to implement additional
functionality to enhance the gameplay experience and provide new opportunities.
These won't be a part of the main game as we do not have source code for the
game client, and frankly it's not worth the hassle to reverse engineer it.

These features may include:
